# hospital_network

## Aim of the Project: 
 This report describes the implementation of network design of a 
Hospital. In this network topology the nodes (i.e., computers, 
switches, routers or other devices) are connected to a local area 
network (LAN) and network via links (twisted pair copper wire 
cable or optical fiber cable). It is designed using Cisco Packet 
Tracer. Itâ€™s a general design on basic hospital design can be used 
as a reference to implement at a higher level to manage network
system. 
There are many devices that were used in designing the network,
such as routers, switches and servers. All devices were 
connected to each other to make integration network system and 
configured by putting IP addresses to all devices. The budget for 
this design network was low. Accordingly, it incorporated several 
mechanisms including a firewall device that prevents any 
unfavorable data from entering into the network. Additionally, all 
devices in the network were secured by passwords, and these 
passwords were encrypted to be more secure. The servers used 
for this network design are HTTP server and DNS servers. This 
presentation and design included additional components such as 
a web server, mail server.
